1)  Difference between **module and package** in Python?
-->Module-module is a single python file(.py), which contains functions, classes, variables.
eg: math.py is a module that provides math functions like sqrt, factorial, ceil, floor...
   -import math- by using this we can use functions in the code
-->Packages- package is a collection(folder) of related modules.
   -It must contains __init__.py file(even if empty) to be treated as package.
eg: numpy is a package with many modules inside
   -import numpy as np - we can perform many task using this package numpy in coding

2) What are **Python namespaces and scope** (LEGB rule)?
-->Namespaces- namespaces are the placeholders like a box(dictionary) that maps names(identifiers) to objects
eg: a=10 #here a is the namespace
LEGB rule - explains python search order
L- local namespaces - variables inside the function
E-Enclosing namespaces - variables from outer of the function(for nested functions)
G- Global namespace - variables which we can access every where it is in the top level of a module
B- Built-in namespaces - functions and exceptions that python provides(print, len, ValueError...)
-->Scope-Scope is where a variable can be accessed or modified within the code.
LEGB rule(Name resolution order):
L-Local- current function scope
E-Enclosing- for outer function's scope(for nested functions)
G-Global-module level scope
B-Built-in - python built in names

3)Explain **import vs from-import**.
-->import- imports the whole module/package
  -we must use module names as a prefix when accessing function/varables(like module.function name)
eg: import math
    print(math.sqrt(16))  # 4    here math is the module name must used in this.
-->from _ import _ - import specific name from modules like(function, variables, classes) into your current namespace
   - we can use them directly without module prefix
eg:  form math import sqrt
     print(sqrt(16))  # 4  here no need of use module - directly accessible

4)What is **virtual environment (venv)** in Python? Why is it needed?
