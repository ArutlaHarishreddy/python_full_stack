1)What is cloud computing, AWS, GCP and web application?
-->cloud computing is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, databases, networking, software and analytics - over the internet(the cloud) instead of local computers or personal servers.
 --Instead of buying and maintaining your own hardware and software, we can rent computing resources from cloud providers.
ex: we can host a website on our laptop and we can upload it to cloud server like AWS or GCP that runs 24/7 and anyone can access it
Advantages
-cost effective : Pay only for what you use
-Scalable: Easily increase or decrease capacity
-Reliable: Data is backed up and secure
-Accessible: Available anywhere in the internet

-->Amazon web services(AWS)
-AWS is also a cloud computing platform, It is one of the largest and most popular tool in the world.
  --it provides such services i.e.:
   -EC2: Virtual servers for hosting applications
   -S3: Cloud storage for files and data
   -RDS: Managed Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL
   -Lambda: Serverless computing 
   -cloudFront: Content Delivery Network(CDN)

ex: we can host our portfolio website on Amazon EC2, store user-images and videos in S3, and manage user data in RDS.

-->Google cloud platform(GCP)
 - GCP is google cloud computing platform, similar to AWS, offering cloud services for computing, storage databases, AI and more...
   common servers
   -compute engine: virtual machines like (AWS EC2)
   -cloud storage: Object storage (like AWS S3)
   -BigQuery: Data Analytics
   -Firebase: Hosting and backend for web/mobile apps
   -App Engine: Platform for deploying web apps easily

-->Web Applications
  -A web application is a program that runs on server and users can access it through browsing like chrome, browser..
ex: Gmail, Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, Amazon, ours Portfolio
  -Structure of web application:
    -Frontend: What users see-- built with HTML, CSS, JS
    -Backend: Handles data and logic -- built with python, NodeJs, PHP, etc..
    -Database: Stores data -- Like MySQL
    -Deployment: Usually done on a cloud platform like AWS or GCP

2)what is microservice?
-->A microservice is small, independent part of a larger application that does specific job and can run on its own.
 -In other words- Instead of building one big application like monolithic, you can build many small services, each handling a specific function, and they communicate with each other with APIs.

3)what are the features of a website?
--> A feature is any functionality or element that improves how users interact with or experience a website.
  -In simple: Features= what the website can do and how it behaves for users.
 -- Based on the websites it have different kind of features such as:
  -Basic Features: Homepage , Navigation menu, content pages, Fast loading speed....
  -User Experience Features: clean design, Interactive elements, Accessibility, search functionality...
  -User Interaction Features: Forms, Reviews, chat support, User Authentication, notifications.....
  -Functional/Dynamic Features: Database integration, admin panel, e-commerce functionality...
  -Security features: HTTPS(SSL certificate), User Authentication, Data Validation, Firewall/Attack protection....
  -Performance and Analytics: CDN(content delivery network), google analytics, error logs/monitoring...
  -Modern/Advanced Features: Animations, Dark themes, Recommendations, voice search or commands...

ex: In a Portfolio website: Homepage, project section, skills section, 	Resume download link, contact form, social media...

4)what is AWS, Lambda, Kinesis?
--> AWS(Amazon web services) It is Amazon cloud computing platform- it provides on demand IT services like
   -servers(EC2)
   -Storage(S3)
   -Databases(RDS)
   -Serverless computing(Lambda)
   -Streaming and data processing(Kinesis)
  -In simple terms AWS lets you rent computers, storage, and other services over the internet- instead of owning physically.

-->Amazon's Lambda: It is a server less computing service.
   -it lets you run your code without managing servers. You can just upload your function or code , and AWS runs it automatically when triggered- you pay only for the time your code runs.
   -In simple - Lambda = Run code in the cloud without worrying  about servers.

-->Amazons Kinesis: AWS kinesis is real time data streaming service.
  -it collects, processes, and analyzes large streams of data real time.
  -Kinesis = AWS service for handling continuous data streams - like live video, sensor data or app logs.

5)What is LLM?
--> LLM stands for Large Language Model is a type of AI model that can understand, generate and interact using human language like English, Telugu...
  -In simple An LLM is computer program trained to read, write, and understand text like a human do.

6)What is vibe coding?
-->Vibe Coding is a relatively new software-development paradigm where instead of writing code line-by-line yourself, you describe what you want in natural language, and a large language model (LLM) or AI tool generates the code for you. The role of the human shifts from authoring code to guiding, prompting, testing and refining AI-generated code.
